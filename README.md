# Accurate AI Image Generator
This repository contains the Python code for an AI-driven application designed to generate historically accurate and culturally sensitive images using a LangChain-like framework. The application leverages a custom prompt template, data integration from historical sources, and feedback mechanisms to improve the accuracy and relevance of generated images.

#Features
Historical Image Prompt Template: Generates detailed prompts that include historical and cultural context to guide the AI in producing accurate images.
Historical Data Integration: Fetches historical context from an external data source or simulated API to provide detailed background information for image generation.
Feedback Mechanism: Allows users to provide feedback on generated images, which is used to refine and improve the prompts and outputs.

#Configuration
API Key: Set your OPENAI_API_API_KEY in your environment variables or .env file.
Data Source: Modify the HistoricalDataIntegration class to connect to your actual historical data source or API.
